//ACTIONS VS ACTION CREATORS
//ACTIONS are basic JS objects, and ACTION CREATORS return said action.
//Three actions below: 1) SELECT_BAND, 2) ADD_BAND, and 3) DELETE_BAND:


// 1 (Note, in this action example, I've added an action creator):
//const SELECT_BAND = SELECT_BAND;
//export function selectBand(band){ //selectBand is an action creator, and needs to return an action
//	return {					//which is an object which MUST have a type property
//		type: "SELECT_BAND",
//		payload: band
//	};
//}

	


// 2:
//const ADD_BAND = ADD_BAND;
//{
//	type: "ADD_BAND",
//	payload: band
//}

// 3:
//const DELETE_BAND = DELETE_BAND; 
//{
//	type: "DELETE_BAND",
//	payload: band
//}
